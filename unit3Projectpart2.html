<figcaption>Colleen is an American comedian, actress, singer and YouTube personality. She is best known for her Internet character Miranda Sings, She created the comically talentless, egotistical and quirky character to satirize the many YouTube videos featuring people singing badly, but who appear unaware of their lack of talent. In her videos and in her stage act, the character sings and dances badly, discusses current events that she often misunderstands, gives inept "tutorials", collaborates with other YouTubers, and rants about her critics, the "haters". Colleen also features comedy and lifestyle videos on her personal YouTube channel, PsychoSoprano. Her YouTube channels, combined, have surpassed 600 million views.  </figcaption>
